**PotionPal allows players to hold an item in their offhand and gain potion effects.**

## What it does
- **Passive effects from items**: Hold a configured item in your main hand or offhand to gain its effect (e.g., Health Boost, Slow Falling, Fire Resistance, Levitation).
- **Clear in‑game feedback**: Optional action bar messages and subtle particles show when an effect is active.
- **Accident-proof**: These special items can’t be placed as blocks by mistake.

## Compatibility
- **Server**: Spigot/Paper 1.20+
- **Command alias**: `potionpal` is also available as `pp`.

## Install
1. Drop the plugin jar into your server’s `plugins` folder.
2. Restart your server.
3. A default `config.yml` is generated with example items ready to use.

## Quick start for admins
- **See available item keys**: `/potionpal list`
- **Give a player an item**: `/potionpal give <player> <itemKey>` (example: `/pp give Alex item1`)
- **Reload settings**: `/potionpal reload`

## Player usage
- **Hold the item**: Put it in the hand the item was made for (most examples use the offhand). The effect is active while you hold it.
- **Feedback**: You may see an action bar note like “Enabled” and small particles when it’s active.
- **Stop holding = effect fades**: Once you stop holding it, the effect ends shortly after.
- **No accidental placement**: You can’t place these special items as blocks.

## Commands
- `/<potionpal|pp> list` — Shows the available item keys.
- `/<potionpal|pp> give <player> <itemKey>` — Gives the selected item to a player.
- `/<potionpal|pp> reload` — Reloads the plugin settings.

## Permissions
- `potionpal.list` — Use `/potionpal list`
- `potionpal.give` — Use `/potionpal give`
- `potionpal.reload` — Use `/potionpal reload`

Grant these to your staff as needed.

## Included examples (out of the box)
- **Health Boost** (offhand): Increases max health.
- **Slow Falling** (offhand): Reduces fall speed.
- **Fire Resistance** (offhand): Protects from fire and lava.
- **Levitation** (offhand): Gently lifts the player.

You can rename items, switch which hand they use, and customize messages/particles through the config.

## Tips
- Want these items sold in a shop or earned as rewards? Use the item keys with your shop/quest plugin to give them to players.
- If an effect isn’t showing, make sure the player is holding the right item in the intended hand and the name matches the special item given by staff.
