GlobalQuests is a Minecraft plugin that enables players to collaborate on server-wide challenges. Players contribute collectively to complete objectives such as:

- Mining a specific number of blocks  
- Collecting experience points (EXP)  
- Killing mobs  
- Farming specific items  
- Crafting x amount of items  
- Placing x amount of blocks  

All progress is tracked globally, and rewards are given when the quest is completed by the community. The plugin is fully configurable and supports custom quest types, dynamic reward distribution, and persistent data saving using simple JSON files.
