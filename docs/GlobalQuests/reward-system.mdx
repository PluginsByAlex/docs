You have control over how rewards are given when a quest is completed:

- **Top Contributors**: You can configure different rewards for the top 3 players based on their contributions.
- **All Participants**: You can optionally enable rewards for everyone who contributed, regardless of amount.
- **Configurable**: This logic is configurable in the plugin's settings so you can choose what fits your server best.
