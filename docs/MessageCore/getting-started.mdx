## Overview

MessageCore lets you send rich, formatted messages to players, consoles, or broadcasts with simple commands and a flexible configuration.

## Installation

1. Drop the jar into your server's `plugins/` folder.
2. Restart the server.
3. Verify that `/msgcore` responds.

## Quick Start

Send a quick message to all players:

```bash
/msgcore broadcast "Welcome to the server!"
```

Send a private message to a player:

```bash
/msgcore send <player> "Hello there!"
```
